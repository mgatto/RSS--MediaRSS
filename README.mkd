Code Status
-----------

This code is pretty alpha. 

The existing script only handles mp4 videos. There is lots of work to be done to make this code reusable and handle more video formats.

To Do
-----
* Package it with Carton so dependencies are added to this repository and not require manual CPAN installs before this can be used.
* Make it a perl module?
* Consider using Image::ExifTool to read MP4,OGV,WEBM.
    * But, what about WMV?
